## Trees

- [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/janwee-sha/algorithms/tree/main/src/main/java/BinarySearchTree). A binary tree that orders its nodes in a way that allows for fast queries.
- [Red-Black Tree](https://github.com/janwee-sha/algorithms/tree/main/src/main/java/RedBlackTree). A self-balancing binary search tree.
- [Heap](https://github.com/janwee-sha/algorithms/tree/main/src/main/java/Heap). A binary tree stored in an array, so it doesn't use pointers. Makes a great priority queue.
- [Trie](https://github.com/janwee-sha/algorithms/tree/main/src/main/java/Trie). A special type of tree used to store associate data structures.
- [B-Tree](https://github.com/janwee-sha/algorithms/tree/main/src/main/java/BTree). A slf-balancing search tree, in which nodes can have more than two children.
