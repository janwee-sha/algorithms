A graph looks like the following picture:

In computer scicence, a graph is defined as a set of *vertices* paired with a set of *edges*. Edges connect a vertex to other vertices.

> Note: Vertices are sometimes called "nodes", and edges are called "links".

Graphs have various shapes and sizes. The edges can have a *weight*, where a positive or negative numeric value is assigned to each edge.

Edges can also be *directed*.

A tree structure and a linked list can be considered graphs but in a simpler form. The both have vertices (nodes) and edges (links).

Another common type of graph is the *directed acyclic graph* or DAG.
